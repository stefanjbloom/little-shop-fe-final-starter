### Abstract:
Ensured fetchData incorporated correct BE endpoint.  I implemented DOM manipulation when calling a method to display coupons. By studying existing js code, was able to hide and show correct data to user and made aesthetic CSS styling changes. 

### Installation Instructions:
Fork both the BE and FE little shop/silk road linked.  Clone down and run the rails server for the BE portion, then 'npm run dev' in FE terminal and follow link  http://localhost:5173/ to open the page.

### Preview of App:

### Context:
I worked about 5 hours on this FE repo.  I researched CSS stylings, dabbled quite a bit in the pages element inspector and read main.js from top to bottom multiple times.

### Learning Goals:
Ruby/Rails, JS, CSS.  Learned how the BE and FE actually communicated and worked in service to each other to create a basic web application.  Spent majority of time with BE Rails.

### Wins + Challenges:
Researching the docs and getting the confidence to try new things.  I was challenged by fear of migrations ruining my work, many, many refactors and diving deep into docs and stack overflow to figure out how I could accomplisha nd create functionality.  Learning wins included cementing TDD knowledge (especially for /requests), building class methods and getting my Postman responses where I wanted them to be.
